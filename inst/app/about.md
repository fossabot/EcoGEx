**Arabidopsis EcoGEx** is a shinny web app to find Expression of a Gene across different accessions/strains of Arabidopsis and their geographical locations information of origin.

By simply using an AGI (Arabidopsis Gene Identifier) you can look at their Expression pattern and also can Compare between diffrent accessions.

Here is an example of some graphical outputs from the results after running the app:
